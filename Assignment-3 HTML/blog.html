        <h1>Learn Simple HTML and CSS</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">As the use of HTML5 and CSS3 continuous to sprung up, folks around the world are looking at 
            them impressively to design their web pages with pixel-perfect standards.<br> 
            HTML5 is much more consideration for its semantic and cross-browser compatibility. It uses relevant tags for common 
            elements such as navigation and footer for an added <br>impact. On the other hand, 
            CSS3 is a sophisticated language that comes packed with many features such as jQuery 
            slider, responsive layout and more to make your design stand out.</p>
        <p>This tutorial talks about creating a minimal blogging site using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. 
            Following the tutorial, you'll be able to create a website that looks simple, implements modern <br>tools and 
            development techniques and makes use of HiFi CMS.</p>

         <h3>Markup</h3>   
         <p>Since our goal is just to create a minimal blogging website, look at the markup of our blog below. There isn't any significant difference in the listing page and there are no comments included 
             <br>in the page. The articles are stacked. You can also see how we have kept the non-semantic stuff at bay. Only a "div" container is used. The top-most bar and other embellishments will be loaded 
             <br>via JavaScript.</p>
        <h3>The CSS: Type</h3>
        <p>It's quite pleasurable to write cascading stylesheets, especially when you are aware of the ins and outs of vertical grids. In the code below, I have used 22px of the grid and applied 
            <br>an accurate styling format to make sure our design fits well. Initially, the process might seem daunting to you, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you'll be amazed to see how easy it was.</p>

        <p>One of the best techniques used to create a grid is to simply pick up a background image and then use it for your grid. However, when selecting an image one needs to ensure that 
            <br>it is 1px wider and taller than your grid. Also, except for the bottom pixel, the rest of the image can be left transparent. You can use a style guide page to preview what you have done 
            <br>so far. For my design, I have applied a grid on everything, ranging from the drop-down, to the comment section and syntax highlighter.</p>

        <h3>The jQuery</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is used quite frequently on the website and when talking about JavaScript it is hard to 
            ignore jQuery. We will use jQuery to create various elements for our website.</p>

        <h3>Bars and Shadow</h3>
        <p>To begin with, markup should be added that I would need for the shadow and bars at the top. Also, it's worth noting that I have completely disregarded the use of padding while
            <br> adding bars. The reason being, it will help you to prevent any kind of haphazard page jumping during CSS loading and executing JavaScript.</p>
