        <h3>What is FlexBox</h3>
        <p>CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox,is a CSS 3 web layout model.
            It is in the W3C's candidate recommendation (CR) stage.The flex layout allows responsive 
            elements<br> within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size (or device).</p>
        <p>Most web pages are written in a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 
            In short, HTML specifies the content and logical structure <br>of the page, while the CSS specifies 
            how it looks: its colors, fonts, formatting, layout, and styling.
            CSS flex-box layout is a particular way to specify the layout of HTML pages.<br>
            One of the most defining features of the flex layout is its ability to form-fit, based on 
            its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in sizeâ€”either decreasing, to avoid 
            unnecessarily<br> monopolizing space, or increasing to make room for contents to be 
            constrained within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms
             of content flow than those, <br>for example, of the block and inline display types, 
             which are generally uni-directional. The flex directional flow can be specified as
              rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards. <br>Individual items within a flex container
               may also be automatically reordered and rearranged to suit the available layout space.
