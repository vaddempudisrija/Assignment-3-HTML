        <h1>CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) </h1>
        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
            of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone <br>technology
         of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
         <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
             and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility<br> and 
             control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
             formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity<br> and 
             repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page 
             load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS</li>
            <li>Internal or Embedded CSS</li>
            <li>External CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
        <p>Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with element is known as 
            inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style 
            attribute. </p>

        <h3>Internal or Embedded CSS</h3>
        <p>This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. The CSS rule set 
            should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML
             file. </p>
        <h3>External CSS</h3>
        <p>External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of 
            tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc). CSS property written in a separate 
            file with<br> .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. This 
            means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web 
            pages.</p>
